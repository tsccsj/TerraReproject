# Advanced Terra Fusion Resampling and Reprojection Tool Testbed
This repository is for the development and testing of algorithms and spatial geometric functionalities for [Advanced Terra Fusion Resampling Tool](https://github.com/TerraFusion/advancedFusion)

# Key Features
1. All calculatations are based on spherical (great circle) distances using the latitude and longtitude of pixels
2. The input pixels are assumned to be irregularily spaced, which is especially true for MODIS
3. The granule for analysis is an entire orbit (one circle of the Terra satallite around the earth)
